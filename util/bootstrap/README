New deployment files:

- init.sh:
  This file can be scp on a blank installation (CentOS or Amazon Linux)
  It can be launched from everywhere, and even if the "madeira.git" repo has already
  been clone.
  Simply launch it this way:
       	 ./init.sh {api,ide,monitor,global|www|my|web,all}

  ex1:   ./init.sh api
  ex2: 	 ./init.sh all

- deploy.sh:
  This file (called by init.sh) deploy the configuration when the "madeira.git" repo
  has already been clone.
  Thus, it is not needed to launch it if you use the init file.
  Launch it at the same way:
       	 ./deploy.sh {api,ide,monitor,global|www|my|web,all}

  ex1:   ./deploy.sh ide
  ex2: 	 ./deploy.sh web


NB: 	 for nginx, the configuration files has to be modified manually to import the
    	 right modules, otherwise, the start fails.
NB2: 	 sometimes, if you shutdown the services using supervisorctl, they're not
	 properly shutdown, and you have to kill them manualy to launch it again.
